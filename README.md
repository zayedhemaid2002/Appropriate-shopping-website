# Abstract: 
In this Project I provide a real-world example displaying the power of the linear algebra in the real life.
# Problems: -
  1. alot of supermarkets.
  2. no ability to choose the best option.
  3. the different price.
  4. waste time and money .
# Solving the problem:
  For example, assume that there are three people would like to buy some products
  intend to buy some rice, sweets and bread. Each of them needs these products in
  different price and can buy them from three Supermarkets, so which supermarket
  will be the best choice for every one of them to buy with less price!
Let P: Product And S: Supermarket cost
P1*S1 + P2*S1+P3*S1 = total cost
