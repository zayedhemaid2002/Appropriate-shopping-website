# Abstract: 
In this Project I provide a real-world example displaying the power of the linear algebra in the real life.
# Problems: -
  1. alot of supermarkets.
  2. no ability to choose the best option.
  3. the different price.
  4. waste time and money .
# Solving the problem:
  For example, assume that there are three people would like to buy some products
  intend to buy some rice, sweets and bread. Each of them needs these products in
  different price and can buy them from three Supermarkets, so which supermarket
  will be the best choice for every one of them to buy with less price!

For example, if person 1 will buy
in supermarket 1:

6 * 5 + 12 * 1 + 1 * 7.50 = 49.50

In supermarket 2:

6 * 4.50 + 12 * 1.25 + 1 * 8 = 50.0

In supermarket 3:

6 * 4.25 + 12 * 1.50 + 1 * 7 = 50.50

The price will person 1 spent in the supermarket 1 will be (element r11),
in the supermarket 2 will be (element r12) And supermarket 3 will be (element r13)
Note its poitrinal for the first person to buy in supermarket 1,
For the second person in supermarket 3 and for the third person in supermarket 1

# The pros for using linear system on the project:
    1. save time while searching on the best price.
    2.  save money
    3. we can use this idea with every smellier idea like clothes shop, food, and Transportation office.
    4.  Flexibility by using this project for different idea.
    5.  satisfy the various needs for the user.
    6.  Increased customer satisfaction.
